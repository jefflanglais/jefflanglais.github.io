I am an effective designer, developer and team leader; excel under deadlines and keeping multiple projects for several clients on task and on schedule; and take pride in making every client feel like theyâ€™re the only one. I am a firm believer in, not only the ability to wear many hats, but the willingness to wear the ones that take you out of your comfort zone.
